             So I made this website to share my feelings and thoughts to you. <br>
                Hope you like it.

                <h2>Letters</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a lot to tell you about my current life and how I'm feeling. 
                    You already know I like you, but it doesn't imply we should be lovers. 
                    What I enjoy is your presence and how you helped me through those 
                    difficult moments. If there is a chance between us, I will not 
                    pressure you to accept my feelings. We spent most of our school 
                    days together, so you already know my story‚Äîwhat happened and 
                    how my past love life went‚Äîso there isn't anything else for me to say. <br>
                    On the other hands, I dun know many things about you that who you like, 
                    what you doing know, how the life is going, who do you like or love. 
                    I think that we haven't many conversation between us and less in-touch 
                    that why I haven't know anything about you. <br>
                    I'm not sure if you still have feelings for my friend 
                    (you know who I'm talking about), so I backed off and kept my distance. 
                    Because we're all single, you can like him back at any time.  I'm not 
                    sure if you have feelings for him or not, so I don't want to try too 
                    hard to flirt with you. Another reason is that you have a lot of 
                    better men around you. They're all better than me, and they're 
                    still near to you (at least they are in same country with you). 
                    I'd like to clarify that I've had feelings for you since 2023, 
                    but they're not because I want to be a lover or take advantage 
                    of you, but because I'm simply feeling this way for you.
                    (Arhh I like you, I want to talk to you, I want to bully you, 
                    and I am happy when I have a conversation to you). <br>
                    I already know that I have a 0.00% chance of making you love me back, 
                    so if you accept my feelings for you, please take as much time as 
                    you need to respond. However, you can decline instantly on 
                    my Instagram DM by saying, "Sorry, I want to stay with a friendship." 
                    If not, send me some emoji to indicate that I understand your 
                    feelings and will take some time to respond. Just follow your heart 
                    and make your own decisions; I accept and respect whatever 
                    decision you make.
